# JavaFX + Java threads seminar
- When started, the program displays a window where the user can select: **(1)** The length of a list of random numbers that is generated by the program and **(2)** the number of threads that the program will use to process this list.
- When the "Calculate" button is pressed, the given number of threads is created. Each thread will check the primality of some of the lists's numbers, so that the work is balanced between all created threads (e.g., 1000 numbers and 4 threads means each thread processes 250 numbers).
- The program waits until all threads have completed their work, at which point the duration of time required is shown in the ListView component.
- Try to run the program using a varying number of threads, starting from 1. You should get the best results (lowest time duration to complete the operation) when the number of threads equals the thread count of your computer's CPU.

### NB! Program is still missing a lot of input validation and should only be used as a starting point!
